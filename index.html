      career you might want to engage in and then watch as your Traveller’s life unfolds – very possibly in a completely different 
      direction!

    <p>
      When you have finished this process, you will be ready for play with a Traveller who has history and a full career (successful or
      otherwise) behind them. They will now be ready for the next phase of their life, one full of excitement and adventure…
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be noted that there are no ‘super’ characters in Traveller. This game is very much based around the idea of putting 
      ordinary people in extraordinary situations, and of playing with the cards that the universe has dealt to you. Be ready to make 
      the best of what you get – much like real life (though real life tends to lack starships, exploding suns and eight foot tall 
      intelligent lion-like aliens).
    </p>
    <p>
      So, another player may end up with a battle-hardened marine who can shoot out a fox’s eye at a hundred paces with any weapon in 
      Charted Space, but your failed rock star who never managed to get anywhere in his career may well have more to contribute to the 
      group. After all, not every problem can be solved with a gun. In fact, in Traveller, a gun may cause more issues than it solves.

  <h3>Characteristics</h3>
  <div>
    <p>
  	  Every person and creature in Traveller has several characteristics that describe their base mental and physical potential. These 
  	  are determined by rolling two D6, six different times, to generate six scores. You can then choose which of these values to apply to 
  	  each statistic. These characteristics may change later during character creation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A value of 7 is considered average, with 2 being the lowest possible value and 12 being the highest. As we roll two dice, extreme 
      values are less likely. There's a 1 in 36 chance of getting 2 (You must roll two 1s), and a 1 in 6 chance of 
      getting 7 (You can roll either a 1 and a 6, or a 2 and a 5, etc.)
    </p>
    <p>
    	Depending on the characteristic score, there is an associated dice modifier (DM). A score of 2 gives a DM of -2; a score of 3 to 5 
    	gives a DM of -1; a score of 6 to 8 gives a DM of 0; a score of 9 to 11 gives a DM of +1; and a score of 12 gives a DM of +2.
    </p>
    <p> 
    	These characteristics also affect your chance of qualifying and being promoted in various jobs in later sections, for instance to 
    	become a Merchant you roll two D6, and add your INT DM. If you score 4 or above you succed in becoming a Merchant. Hover over the 
    	characteristics below to see which jobs rely on them and the dice roll needed. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Roll the dice then drag them into the box you want.

  <h3>Starting Skills</h3>
  <div>
  	<p>
  		Skills are the most important aspect of a Traveller, and represents how well they can perform various tasks. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		If a character is untrained in a skill they suffer a DM-3 when trying to use that skill. If a character has level zero that means 
  		that they are competent in using that skill, but has had little experience. They do not get any bonuses but avoid the -3 penalty.
  		If a traveller has one or more levels in a skill (Skill 1, Skill 2, etc.) they are trained. Levels 2-3 indicate a skilled 
  		profesional, and 4-5 mean the character is probably well respected and known at least planet wide. Each level indicates several 
  		years of experience using that skill, and grants DM+1 per level for any checks using that skill. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
      Some skills have specialities – specialised, more focussed forms of that skill. A Traveller picks a speciality when he gains level 1 
      in a skill that has two or more specialities. For example, a Traveller might have Engineer 0, allowing him to make Engineer skill checks 
      without the unskilled penalty. He might then gain a level in Engineer, at which point he would need to choose a speciality. For Engineer, 
      this is a choice between jump drive, manoeuvre drive, power plant and electronics.
  	</p>
  	<p>
      Before embarking on your careers, you receive a number of level zero skills equal to your Education DM +3, chosen from the list below. This
      represents the knowledge you have picked up during adolescence and will allow you to function at a basic level in a technological society.
  	</p>
  	<div id="startingSkills"></div>
  	<br/>

  	<ul class="checkbox-grid">
  		<li title="Admin: This skill covers bureaucracies and administration of all sorts, including the navigation of bureaucratic obstacles or disasters. It also covers tracking inventories, ship manifests and other records."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkAdmin" value="Admin"/> Admin 0</li>
  		<li title="Animals: This skill, rare on industrialised or technologically advanced worlds, is for the care of animals."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkAnimals" value="Animals" /> Animals 0</li>
  		<li title="Art: The Traveller is trained in a type of creative art."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkArt" value="Art" /> Art 0</li>
  		<li title="Athletics: The Traveller is a trained athlete and is physically fit. The Athletics skill effectively augments a Traveller’s physical characteristics; whatever you can do with Strength alone you can also add your Athletics (strength) DM to, for example. Athletics is also the principal skill used in adverse gravitational environments, specifically Athletics (dexterity) in low or zero-G, and Athletics (strength) in high-G locations."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkAthletics" value="Athletics" /> Athletics 0</li>
  		<li title="Carouse: Carousing is the art of socialising; having fun, but also ensuring other people have fun, and infectious good humour. It also covers social awareness and subterfuge in such situations."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkCarouse" value="Carouse" /> Carouse 0</li>
  		<li title="Drive: This skill is for controlling ground vehicles of various types. There are several specialities."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkDrive" value="Drive" /> Drive 0</li>
  		<li title="Electronics: This skill is used to operate electronic devices such as computers and ship-board systems. Higher levels represent the ability to repair and create electronic devices and systems. There are several specialities."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkElectronics" value="Electronics" /> Electronics 0</li>
  		<li title="Flyer: The various specialities of this skill cover different types of flying vehicles. Flyers only work in an atmosphere; vehicles that can leave the atmosphere and enter orbit generally use the Pilot skill."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkFlyer" value="Flyer" /> Flyer 0</li>
  		<li title="Language: There are numerous different Language specialities, each one covering reading and writing a different language. All Travellers can speak and read their native language without needing the Language skill, and automated computer translator programs mean Language skills are not always needed on other worlds. Having Language 0 implies the Traveller has a smattering of simple phrases in several languages."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkLanguage" value="Language" /> Language 0</li>
  		<li title="Mechanic: The Mechanic skill allows a Traveller to maintain and repair most equipment – some advanced equipment and spacecraft components require the Engineer skill. Unlike the narrower and more focussed Engineer or Science skills, Mechanic does not allow a Traveller to build new devices or alter existing ones – it is purely for repairs and maintenance but covers all types of equipment."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkMechanic" value="Mechanic" /> Mechanic 0</li>
  		<li title="Medic: The Medic skill covers emergency first aid and battlefield triage as well as diagnosis, treatment, surgery and longterm care."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkMedic" value="Medic" /> Medic 0</li>
  		<li title="Profession: A Traveller with a Profession skill is trained in producing useful goods or services. There are many different Profession specialities, but each one works the same way – the Traveller can make a Profession check to earn money on a planet that supports that trade. The amount of money raised is Cr250 x the Effect of the check per month. Unlike other skills with specialties, levels in the Profession skill do not grant the ability to use other specialties at level 0. Each specialty must be learned individually. Someone with a Profession skill of 0 has a general grasp of working for a living but little experience beyond the most menial jobs."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkProfession" value="Profession" /> Profession 0</li>
  		<li title="Science: The Science skill covers not just knowledge but also practical application of that knowledge where such practical application is possible. There are a large range of specialities."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkScience" value="Science" /> Science 0</li>
  		<li title="Seafarer: The Seafarer skill covers all manner of watercraft and ocean travel."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkSeafarer" value="Seafarer" /> Seafarer 0</li>
  		<li title="Streetwise: A Traveller with the Streetwise skill understands the urban environment and the power structures in society. On his homeworld and in related systems, he knows criminal contacts and fixers. On other worlds, he can quickly intuit power structures and can fit into local underworlds."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkStreetwise" value="Streetwise" /> Streetwise 0</li>
  		<li title="Survival: The Survival skill is the wilderness counterpart of the urban Streetwise skill – the Traveller is trained to survive in the wild, build shelters, hunt or trap animals, avoid exposure and so forth. He can recognise plants and animals of his homeworld and related planets, and can pick up on common clues and traits even on unfamiliar worlds."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkSurvival" value="Survival" /> Survival 0</li>
  		<li title="Vacc Suit: The Vacc Suit skill allows a Traveller to wear and operate spacesuits and environmental suits. A Traveller will rarely need to make Vacc Suit checks under ordinary circumstances – merely possessing the skill is enough. If the Traveller does not have the requisite Vacc Suit skill for the suit he is wearing, he suffers DM-2 to all skill checks made while wearing a suit for each missing level. This skill also permits the character to operate advanced battle armour."><input onclick="numberValidSkills()" type="checkbox" id="chkVaccSuit" value="Vacc Suit" /> Vacc Suit 0</li>
  	</ul>

  	<button id="confirmSkills" onclick="changeActiveAccordion(3); setInitialSkills()">Continue</button>

  </div>
  <h3>Starting out</h3>
  <div>

  	<p>
  		Next, your Traveller engages in one or more career terms, representing their previous experiences and adventures before the start 
  		of the campaign. Each career term lasts for four years, even if a Traveller fails a Survival roll or is forced to leave a career. 
  		At many points during a career, a Traveller will have to make a dice roll of some sort. Most of these rolls are based on 
  		characteristics – simply roll 2D, add the DM from the listed characteristic, and try to get a total higher than or equal to the 
  		listed value. So, a roll of INT 8+ means ‘roll 2D, add your Intellect DM, and you succeed if you roll an 8 or more’. 
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		In each career, there are three assignments, representing different aspects of the career. Pick one of these assignments when you 
  		enter the career. For example under the Rogue career there are the assignments Thief, Enforcer or Pirate.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		You can also choose to enter either University or Military Academy instead during your first, second or third term. If you fail entry
  		during your first term you can try again in your second or third, however the dice roll gets harder in each subsequent year. If you
  		fail to qualify you then attempt to join a career as normal. Attending university or Military Academy provides the chance to gain 
  		increases to your Education characteristic, as well as skills, bonuses to rolls to qualify for other careers, and the chance to roll
  		for commission before the first term of a military career, entering as an officer.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		Also, keep track of your age. After you turn 34 there is a small but increasing chance each term that you will lose points in one or
  		more characteristics.
  	</p>

  	<h3> Career checklist </h3>

  	<ul>
  		<li>
  		  First, if it's in the first three terms, decide whether or not to apply University or Military Academy, and roll to see if you succeed
  		  in qualifying. If unsuccesful apply for a career as normal, otherwise choose which skills you learn, roll for events, and then roll for
  		  graduation. After your University/Military Academy proceed to the next term.
  		</li>
  		<li> If not entering pre-career education, pick which career you would like to apply for. If this is your first time in this career, roll 
  			to qualify. If you fail to qualify either choose the drifter career or enter the draft to be randomly assigned a military career (You
  			may only enter the draft once in your lifetime).
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			Each career has four or five types of skill table associated with it – Personal Development, Service Skills, Specialist Skills, officer
  			skills and Advanced Education. In each term you spend in a career, pick one of these tables and roll 1D to see which skill you increase.
  			If this is your first career you gain basic training in all of the service skills at level 0. In the first term of subsequent careers 
  			you pick only one service skill.
  		</li>
  		<li>
  		    Next roll the survival check to see if you suffer a mishap and are forced to leave your career. Assuming you don't, roll the event check
  		    to see what interesting thing befalls you.
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			If you are in a military career, you can then roll for commission to become a rank 1 officer, allowing access to the officer tables. If
  			your social standing is below 9 you may only roll for commission in your first term.
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			Every career has a mandatory roll for advancement, which is different to the commission. If you make a successful advancement roll you gain
  			a rank in the career and get an extra roll on any of the skills and training tables as well as any bonuses listed. However, if your 
  			advancement roll is equal to or less than the number of terms you have spent in this career, then you cannot continue in this career after 
  			this term. Either your services are no longer required, or events have caused you to leave, or perhaps you are simply bored and want a new 
  			challenge. If you roll a natural 12, then you must continue in this career. You are too valuable to lose and will be strong-armed into 
  			staying.
  		</li>
  		<li>
  			Finally, decide whether to continue to the next term or finish character creation. When you leave a career for any reason, you gain material
  			benefits from that career, representing money, equipment and influence acquired during your years of work. There are two tables for this in
  			each career – Cash and Benefits. You may only roll on Cash tables a maximum of three times in your lifetime, regardless of how many careers 
  			or Benefit rolls you accumulate. You receive one Benefit roll per full term served. Leaving due to a mishap means you lose the Benefit roll 
  			for that term, but you still gain the benefit rolls for previous terms in that career. If you reached rank 1 or 2, you get an extra Benefit 
  			roll when leaving that career. If you reached rank 3 or 4, you get two extra Benefit rolls, and if you reached rank 5 or 6, you get three 
  			extra Benefit rolls and may also apply DM+1 to all rolls on the Cash and Benefits tables. 
  		</li>
